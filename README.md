## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- GRID
- FLEXBOX
- js

### What I learned

It turns out that there is much more for me to understand the overall planning process to write cleaner code.
I got better experience with choosing suitable properties for positioning elements in specific situations.
I got a better understanding of using one class for more different HTML elements.


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - This helped me better understand positioning and the overall planning process. I'd recommend his youtube channel to anybody who starts learning the front end.
